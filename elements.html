                The City of New York, often called New York City (NYC) or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city
                in both the state of New York and the United States.[11] With an estimated 2017 population of
                8,622,698[7] distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles (784 km2),[12][13] New York is
                also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[14] Located at the southern tip of the
                state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan
                area in the world by urban landmass[15] and one of the world's most populous megacities,[16][17] with an
                estimated 20,320,876 people in its 2017 Metropolitan Statistical Area and 23,876,155 residents in its
                Combined Statistical Area.[4][5] A global power city,[18]
                New York City has been described as the
                cultural,[19][20][21][22] financial,[23][24] and media capital of the world,[25][26] and exerts a
                significant impact upon commerce,[24] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism,
                art, fashion, and sports. The city's fast pace[27][28] has inspired the term New York minute.[29] Home
                to the headquarters of the United Nations,[30] New York is an important center for international
                diplomacy.[31][32]
                <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FjU_x1106pg/maxresdefault.jpg"/>
                Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors,[33][34] New York City consists of five boroughs,
                each of which is a separate county of the State of New York.[35] The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens,
                Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[36] The city and
                its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States.[37] As
                many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[38][39][40] making it the most linguistically diverse city
                in the world.[39][41][42] New York City is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the
                United States,[43] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world.[44] In 2017, the New
                York metropolitan area produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of US$1.73 trillion.[9] If greater
                New York City were a sovereign state, it would have the 12th highest GDP in the world.[45] New York is
                home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.[46]

                New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624
                on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626.[47] The city and its surroundings came
                under English control in 1664[47] and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the
                lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[48] New York served as the capital of the United States from
                1785 until 1790.[49] It has been the country's largest city since 1790.[50] The Statue of Liberty
                greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th
                centuries[51] and is an international symbol of the United States and its ideals of liberty and
                peace.[52] In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and
                entrepreneurship,[53] social tolerance,[54] and environmental sustainability,[55][56] and as a symbol of
                freedom and cultural diversity.[57]

                Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, with the city having three of the world's
                ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013[58] and receiving a record 62.8 million tourists in
                2017.[59] Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world.[60][61] Times
                Square, iconic as the world's "heart"[62] and its "Crossroads",[63] is the brightly illuminated hub of
                the Broadway Theater District,[64] one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections,[65][66] and a
                major center of the world's entertainment industry.[67] The names of many of the city's landmarks,
                skyscrapers,[68] and parks are known around the world. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most
                expensive in the world.[69][70] New York is home to the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of
                Asia,[71][72] with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city.[73][74][75] Providing
                continuous 24/7 service,[76] the New York City Subway is the largest single-operator rapid transit
                system worldwide, with 472 rail stations.[77][78][79] Over 120 colleges and universities are located in
                New York City, including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which
                have been ranked among the top universities in the world.[80][81] Anchored by Wall Street in the
                Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York has been called both the most economically powerful city
                and the leading financial center of the world,[24][82][83][84] and the city is home to the world's two
                largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.[85][86]
